I'm a **fullstack developer** in a JavaScript environment since my first IT job, doing my best to **build products in an agile way**. In a daily basis, **my goal is that everyone can progress** and improve their skills by learning new things. Personally, I used to **read a lot about technology or teams**, and discover new tech things by doing some small projects.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy **living outdoors adventures**, doing trail running, hiking and bike-packing. I found the path of a journey more exciting that the destination, because it's where you discover the more.

**Cooking** is also a hobby, so I decide to associate outdoors and food by sharing some of my main recipes in the blog [**cookforadventure.com**](https://cookforadventure.com).
