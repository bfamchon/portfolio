Development of a solution for elderly assistance, made with love in Roubaix ðŸ¤–

In the Cutii ecosystem, I'm involved in the development of web applications, embedded as well as our servers. Without forgetting the deployment of the whole technical stack on our providers.

Giving a lot of importance to the product and agility, I also work on the research and definition of the need of our users... All of this is transcribed and prioritized in order to deliver high value-added features as quickly as possible! ðŸš€
